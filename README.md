# unity-bird-game

This is a small project I did on the Unity game engine. It is a game similar to flappy bird.

As this is my first time using Unity, I followed this tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&pp=ygUOdW5pdHkgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D

The files are the source code for each component in the game (coded in C#).
